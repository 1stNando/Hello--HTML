    <h1>Capabilities</h1>
    <p>
      No better way to describe, in as brief as possible, and as simple as
      possible, than the chatbot itself. Quote: "As a large language model
      trained by OpenAI, my capabilities are avast and varied. I am designed to
      understand natural language input and generate natural language output,
      which means I can communicate with humans in a way that feels intuitive
      and familiar."
    </p>
    <p2>
      It continues the quote with: "I can answer questions, provide information,
      and engage in conversation on a wide range of topics, drawing on a vast
      databse of knowledge and information that has been gathered from a diverse
      array of sources. I can also perform tasks such as language translation,
      summarization, and sentiment analysis, and I can generate text in a
      variety of styles and formats, including essays, stories, and poetry."</p2

      >The chatbot then finishes with more specific description, "In terms of my
      specific capabilities, I can provide answers and insights on virutally any
      topic, from science and technology to history and literature. I can help
      with research, assist with writing assignments, and even provide feedback
      on creative work. Overall, my capabilities are limited only to the scope
      of human knowledge and the capacity of language to convey meaning and
      ideas."</p3
