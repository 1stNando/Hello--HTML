    <h1>Hello, World. Have you heard of an AI Chatbot?</h1>
    <h1>Enter ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence (AI), became available to the public at the start
      of 2023. This was possible thanks to Microsoft, who purchased ChatGPT from
      the developers at OpenAI, and integrated it into their search engine Bing.
      ChatGPT is a type of Chatbot who can return information based on the type
      of statement it is presented. It is said to be artificially intelligent.
    </p>
    <h2>What is it capable of?</h2>
    <p>
      As the name describes, a chatbot is able to mimic a human conversation.
      But this is only the tip of the iceberg. It is able to read and write
      computer programs and debug them. It can write music lyrics and songs with
      complete musical structure and semantics.
    </p>
    <h3>Here are some of the first queries I tried asking it:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tell a joke (multiple times)</li>
      <li>Write a full rap song</li>
      <li>To describe your capabilities to a college class</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you want to try it yourself, go to the
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com" title="ChatGPT link"> OpenAI</a>
      Website.
